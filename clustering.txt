Measuring cluster Quality:

        External Measures
            It is supervised. We employ a criteria not inherent to the Dataset
            Compare clustering against prior or expert-specified Knowledge using
            certain clustering quality measure.
                Cluster Homogenity, The purer the better
                Cluster Completeness
            Matching used External Measures:
                Purity
                Maximum Matching, F-Measure
            Entropy-Based Measures:
                Conditional Entropy
                Normalised Mutual Information
                Variation of Information
            Pair-wise Measures:
                TP,TN,FP,FN
                Jaccard Coeff, Rand Statistic, Howlkes-mallow Measure
            Correlation Measures:
                Discretised Huber Static
                Normalised Discretised Huber Static    

        Internal Measures
            BetaCV Measure
                A trade off intra-cluster compactness and inter cluster seperation
            Normalised cut 
                The higer the Normalised Value the better the clustering
            Modularity
                It measures the difference between the observed and expected fraction 
                of weights on edges within clusters
                The smaller the value the better the clustering-- The intra-cluster distances
                are lower than expected.

        Relative Measures

            Directly Compare  different clusterings, usually those obtained via different
            parameter settings for the same algorithm
